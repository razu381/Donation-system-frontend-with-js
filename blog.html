            To make a donation, simply navigate to the "Donate" page on our
            website. Select the cause or program you'd like to support, choose
            your donation amount, and fill in your personal details. We offer
            several payment options, including credit/debit cards, PayPal, and
            bank transfers. Once your payment is processed, you will receive an
            email confirmation and a receipt for your records. If you encounter
            any issues during the donation process, feel free to reach out to
            our support team for assistance.

          Is my donation tax-deductible?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="font-light text-base">
            Yes, in most cases, your donation may be tax-deductible. We are a
            registered [501(c)(3)] nonprofit organization (or relevant legal
            status in your country), meaning that donations are typically
            eligible for tax deductions. After completing your donation, you
            will receive a confirmation email that includes a receipt. This
            receipt can be used when filing your taxes to claim the deduction.
            For more detailed information, we recommend consulting with your tax
            advisor to confirm how the deduction applies based on your location
            and donation amount.

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="font-light text-base">
            Absolutely! We understand that some donors prefer to remain
            anonymous. During the donation process, you will have the option to
            select "Donate Anonymously." This means your name and personal
            information will not be displayed publicly or shared with third
            parties. However, even if you donate anonymously, you will still
            receive a confirmation email and tax receipt for your donation (if
            applicable). Rest assured, we take your privacy very seriously and
            ensure all personal information is handled securely.

            We believe in full transparency and want you to know exactly how
            your donation is making a difference. Depending on the cause or
            program you choose to support, your donation may go towards funding
            specific projects, such as providing clean water, education, or
            emergency relief. We allocate funds based on the most pressing
            needs, ensuring that your donation has the greatest possible impact.
            You can also check our annual reports and financial statements on
            our website, which detail how funds are distributed and used to
            achieve our mission.

          Can I set up a recurring donation?

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="font-light text-base">
            Yes, you can! Setting up a recurring donation allows you to support
            our cause on an ongoing basis without needing to manually donate
            each time. When making a donation, simply select the "Recurring
            Donation" option and choose the frequency (monthly, quarterly,
            yearly) that works best for you. Recurring donations provide us with
            a steady stream of support, helping us plan and sustain long-term
            projects. You can adjust or cancel your recurring donation at any
            time by logging into your account or contacting our donor support
            team.
